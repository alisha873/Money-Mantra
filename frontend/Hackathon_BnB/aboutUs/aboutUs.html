      <h2>Our Idea</h2>
      <p>Our idea bridges the gap felt by all college students and fresh graduates alike. We often hear, “Schools should teach you how to do your taxes.” Well, the sad reality is that they really don’t. But hey, we can’t fix our system, but we sure can help you out where it doesn’t. We bring to you “Money Mantra” – a website that provides an AI-powered tax summarizer that, in simple terms, helps you do your taxes based on the information you provide. And if you’re worried that you don’t have enough knowledge and get intimidated whenever someone throws financial jargon at you, fear not. We’ve also got a customized and tailored learning experience for all users that sign up, making sure everyone walks away knowing more than they came in and also not worried about their taxes.</p>

      <h2>Why We Chose This Idea</h2>
      <p>As mentioned above, countless Instagram posts and conversations with friends brought up the lack of education and free help for people like us trying to figure out financial lingo and taxes. We believe a good idea always caters to a problem and works towards solving it, and this marks our first step towards solving a problem universal to all.</p>
